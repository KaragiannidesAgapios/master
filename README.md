RESPONSIVE FLEXBOX GRID<br><br>
This is nothing more than a reusable flexbox grid, easy to use in any project. In fact this is a simple tool that comes handy whenever itâ€™s necessary. It has been made responsive (media included) both for medium and small devices.
<br>As a matter of fact, this is how it should look like if we add some simple divs.
